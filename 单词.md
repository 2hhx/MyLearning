**interval：区间**
- open interval:开区间
- closed interval: 闭区间
A = [8,7,2,4,6,9,8,9,1,3]
B = [1,1,1,3,3,5,8,4,2,2]
those numbers less than five are allocated in the first interval, i.e., interval $i_1$ , and
the rest in the second interval, interval $i_2$

**instance:实例**
Now, let us assume to have an instance $x_1 = 3$ that should be classified into either
Class A or Class B.

**classified**
It can easily be discovered that 3 belongs to the first interval,
$i_1$ , as it is less than 5.

**empirical：** 以实验（或经验）为依据的；based on experiments or experience rather than ideas or theories
- **empirical results**:实证结果
- In the next section the empirical results for both approaches is presented and also compared with a recent study.

**theoretical：** 理论上的；反义词：empirical

**Subsection**：
- To evaluate the proposed approach, a set of data were obtained and a number of
experiments were conducted. Subsection 4.1 describes the dataset, while Subsection
4.2 reports and compares the final results.
