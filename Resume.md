# self-assessment 
&emsp;&emsp;From the freshman's exposure to the C language, its process-oriented style has made me very uncomfortable. It wasn't until my sophomore year that I started learning JAVA. After writing the first line of JAVA code, I found that the original programming can be like this. We can abstract everything into objects. As my real programming enlightenment language, the characteristics of JAVA make me think about programming from a person who doesn't like programming. During college, I also used JAVA to develop some small programs, from console programs to desktop programs and javaWeb, and android applications. After graduating , I began to be exposed to software and hardware co-design, during which I also taught myself techniques such as python, node.js, and WeChat applet development. And after so long learning, I also want to go to work to hone myself, see the real development process, and learn the most mainstream technologies and frameworks. I also look forward to working with the big guys in Google to improve myself.
