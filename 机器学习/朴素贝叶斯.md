$ p(c | E)=\frac{p(E | c) p(c)}{p(E)} $

Na√Øve Bayes classifier is also easy to implement. The most time-consuming part is how to compute p(E | c) in Eq. 1. This probability calculation is important to make the classifier more accurate. In basic literatures of pattern recognition or machine learning, it is proposed that this probability can be estimated by some standard data distribution such as Gaussian or Poisson [20].
