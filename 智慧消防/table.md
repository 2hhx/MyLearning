The relationship of ERC and SC to BI is shown in the fire characteristics chart in Table 2
(Andrews and Rothermel, 1982).

A cross-reference for BI to potential flame length, fireline intensity and descriptions of expected
prescribed burning and fire suppression conditions is provided in Table 1 (adapted from
Deeming et al. 1977).

## 阐述影响因素
- **Many factors** will affect the development and outcome of a dwelling fire. 
  - **One of these factors is** the fuel present; 
    - dwellings often **feature** (由……组成) highly combustible and toxic materials that result in rapid development of fires and production of lethal gases.
  - **Another important aspect** of dwelling fires is the behavior of the occupants. 
    - Deciding whether to fight the fire or escape may significantly affect the chances of survival. 
  - The physical features of a dwelling also **have a major role to play in** the outcome of a fire,
    -  for example, the availability of passive fire protection measures (fire doors, fire-resistant upholstery, etc.)
    - and active ones (smoke alarms, sprinklers, etc.)

Case studies **demonstrate** how the survival of the occupant can be affected by conditions such as the location of the property and the intervention of the fire service. **Some interesting contributions are made** ; **however, it was noted that** the work **did not address** fires that became complicated and spread to other dwellings. **This is an issue that is addressed in this article**.
